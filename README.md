## Election - Audit Summary
Considering the amlitude of data required to pull such findings, using a script to sort through the data has proven to be most useful in being able to clearly isolate the main paints of this election. Once the basis of the script has been construsted, it could serve as a valuable tool for many other elections to come. Making changes to the script can allow for many more key points to be analyzed. For example we could create decidion statements to determine what percentage of votes a candidate received from whcih state in a federal election. Another modification could be made to determine winning percentage of many other types of elections no matter the scale.
To incorprate a system such as this one can provide ample insight for the course of any future elections.
